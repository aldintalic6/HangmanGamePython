# HangmanGamePython

This project is a Hangman Game project written in plain Python. 

Features: 
The game randomly selects a word from this database for each round. It displays the current state of the word with underscores for unrevealed letters, the letters guessed so far, and the number of attempts remaining. A representation of the Hangman figure is implemented, updating it with each incorrect guess. A scoring system is also present that penalizes the player for incorrect guesses. The game is over when the player wins by guessing the word or loses by running out of attempts. If the player runs out of attempts, the wanted word is shown.
